<p>
One first step to diversifying a conference is creating a diversity statement for your organization that is specific and contains concrete actions.  Saying “diversity is important” is vague and doesn’t include the possibility that the organization itself has a problem.  A strong diversity statement contains both values and concrete actions that encourage practices which are inclusive of people from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>
<p>“We are committed to treating each other in a respectful manner.”</p>
<p>“We encourage people to express differing opinions in an open and honest manner.”</p>
<p>“We are committed to having a conference with speakers from marginalized groups.”</p>

<p>These principles, of course, need to be backed up with actions which support them.</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to diversify the people who are in your speaker pool. The goal of a diverse speaker pool is to include the voices of people who are members of marginalized groups.  These groups include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability, citizenship status, and age.
</p>

<p>
Pro-active outreach to marginalized communities is necessary to build and maintain a diverse pool of speakers. By creating ongoing relationships with diverse groups, your organization is demonstrating an ongoing commitment to diversity and change.</p>
<p>
Start by finding special interest groups in your field. Generally you can find these affinity groups by asking around and searching for information online.
</p>
<p>
When reaching out to marginalized communities be sure to do so early and often.  Contact groups with personalized messages that explain your organization is interested in hearing from new speakers particularly those from marginalized groups. Put in place methods to encourage and support new speakers.  If your event doesn’t have a history of diversity, there is no reason for people from marginalized groups to expect that they will be selected for inclusion or that they will be treated respectfully.

				  Many studies have shown that unconscious bias is pervasive and inevitably favors white men.  It’s important to take steps to actively disrupt biased There are a variety of methods to actively disrupt bias.  </p>

  <p>

One method is to use “blind selection” of speakers.  To use this method you have speakers submit written materials that have identifying information removed.  The goal is to select speakers without taking into consideration the person’s social identity.    </p>

  <p>

When a speaker pool reaches broadly across many communities, the distribution of selected speakers is extremely unlikely to be all white guys. It’s possible that white guys won’t be the majority of speakers and that’s OK.  In fact it’s fantastic.  </p>

<p>				   
Make sure that your organization uses inclusive language.  This means using gender neutral language, limiting use of jargon and making broad generalizations about groups of people.  The goal is to make sure what you say includes the everyone in the audience.  
</p>
<p>
For example, instead of saying “hi guys” or “hello ladies and gentlemen” try saying “hi folks” or “hello everyone.”
