<p>
One first step to diversifying a conference is creating a diversity statement for your organization that is specific and contains concrete actions.  Saying “diversity is important” is vague and doesn’t include the possibility that the organization itself has a problem.  A strong diversity statement contains both values and concrete actions that encourage practices which are inclusive of people from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>
<p>“We are committed to treating each other in a respectful manner.”</p>
<p>“We encourage people to express differing opinions in an open and honest manner.”</p>
<p>“We are committed to having a conference with speakers from marginalized groups.”</p>

<p>These principles, of course, need to be backed up with actions which support them.</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to diversify the people who are in your speaker pool. The goal of a diverse speaker pool is to include the voices of people who are members of marginalized groups.  These groups include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, disability, citizenship status, and age.
</p>

<p>
Pro-active outreach to marginalized communities is necessary to build and maintain a diverse pool of speakers. By creating ongoing relationships with diverse groups, your organization is demonstrating an ongoing commitment to diversity and change.</p>
<p>
Start by finding special interest groups in your field. Generally you can find these affinity groups by asking around and searching for information online.
</p>
<p>
When reaching out to marginalized communities be sure to do so early and often.  Contact groups with personalized messages that explain your organization is interested in hearing from new speakers particularly those from marginalized groups. Put in place methods to encourage and support new speakers.  If your event doesn’t have a history of diversity, there is no reason for people from marginalized groups to expect that they will be selected for inclusion or that they will be treated respectfully.

				  Many studies have shown that unconscious bias is pervasive and inevitably favors white men.  It’s important to take steps to actively disrupt biased There are a variety of methods to actively disrupt bias.  </p>

  <p>

One method is to use “blind selection” of speakers.  To use this method you have speakers submit written materials that have identifying information removed.  The goal is to select speakers without taking into consideration the person’s social identity.    </p>

  <p>

When a speaker pool reaches broadly across many communities, the distribution of selected speakers is extremely unlikely to be all white guys. It’s possible that white guys won’t be the majority of speakers and that’s OK.  In fact it’s fantastic.  </p>

			  <a href="#panel5">Codes Of Conduct And Effective Enforcement</a>
				<div id="panel5" class="content">
				  <p> There is no way to include everyone in your event.  If your event includes people who make other attendees uncomfortable and unsafe, the people they target will not enjoy attending.  The choice is between explicit exclusion of harassers or the implicit exclusion of the people they target.  An Anti-Harassment Policy or Code of Conduct is the first step in choosing explicit exclusion of harassers so that everyone else can enjoy your event.  The <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism</a> has excellent information about composing a new policy.</p>

<p>An Anti-Harassment policy or Code of Conduct serves as a signalling mechanism, telling people who have the experience of being targeted in the past that they will not be expected to tolerate harassment when it happens.  It also discouraging anyone who would largely attend your conference just to make it less pleasant for other attendees, which is a net win.  The lack of any policy will send the signal that if someone targets an attendee there will be no remedy.  This is a depressingly common experience; it is useful to indicate that your event intends to be different.</p>

<p>However, harassment will happen anyway, especially at conferences without a history of enforcing their policy.  The policy is a necessary piece of an system to address harassing behavior, but it is only one piece.  It needs to be accompanied by an effective reporting and enforcement mechanism to carry weight.  </p>

<p>Your policy is a promise about how your event will handle specific situations.  <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy_resources#Preparing_to_enforce_the_policy">The Geek Feminism Wiki</a> has advice on preparing to follow through on that promise, with recommendations for before, during and after the event.  Additionally, consider reaching out to a local organizations that offers training in handling sexual harassment.  For example, some conventions in the Boston area <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/shira-lipkin/so-you-have-a-harassment-policy-now-what/10151947677227869">collaborated with the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center</a> to train their staff and volunteers. </p>

<p>In addition to enforcing the policy, it is helpful to publicize the expectations widely, especially in the space where the event is happening.  Examples from other events include prominently feature a link on your event's website, include the policy on your registration forms, print it in your programs or putting it on giant banners in the entryway.  It is also great to make the people responsible for enforcing the policy visible with shirts, buttons, hats, ribbons or some other form of obviously advertising who to talk to. It is good to make it easy to report, even for things that don't unambiguously violate the policy, since less-overt harassment can often be part of a pattern of behavior by more sophisticated harassers. Events can also encourage bystander solidarity through programs like <a href="http://backupribbonproject.com/">The Backup Ribbon Project.</a>  These obvious reminders can discourage harassers while empowering their targets by constantly reminding attendees of the event's standards.</p>
