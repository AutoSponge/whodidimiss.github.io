<p>Here are some sample letters you can customize to apply to the event that is missing voices of marginalized groups.  </p>

<p>Sample 1: (already attended event)</p>
<p>While I attended <input type="text" style="display: inline" placeholder="Conference Name"/> last weekend, I was disappointed to notice the oversights in your speaker line up leading to it being made up of nothing but <input type="text" style="display: inline" placeholder="the over-represented group, i.e. white people"/>.<select name="additionalinformation"> <option value="" selected></option><option value="2">Perhaps your prioritization of people with their own books to sell led to inadvertent systematic discrimination, as you were reliant on the discriminatory publishing world and more generally on people without significant non-work-related demands on their time. Since I was also disappointed in how much of the conference devolved into the speakers plugging their own books, I am confident you could kill two birds with one stone by instead seeking out the most qualified speakers.</option><option value="3">Perhaps your selection process produced a skewed pool of potential speakers, but it is disappointing that when you saw that outcome you did not step back to consider which speakers were missing from consideration.</option> <option value="4">Perhaps your inability to cover even conference expenses, much less compensate your speakers, led to only people with the support of a company being willing to parcipate, leaving you vulnerable to the discriminatory policies of those companies.  Even if you do not routinely cover expenses or provide compensation, consider reaching out directly to speakers that would enrich your program and offering to compensate them.</option></select>

This impression has a direct impact on your company.  I wanted to share with you that when trying to build a group from <input type="text" style="display:inline;" placeholder="Your Company or organization"/> to attend this weekend, it was difficult to generate interest among some people who would normally be enthusiastic about attending an event like yours.  Without any <input type="test" style="display:inline;" placeholder="The marginalize group overlooked"/> speaking <select style="display:inline;"><option value="" selected></option><option value=", a code of conduct"> or even a token of effort towards diversity, there was no evidence that there would exist other $MARGINALIZED_GROUP there or that the organizers of this event see $MARGINALIZED_GROUP as peers.  This is likely to be reflected in the attendees of the conference, cultivating an atmosphere that supports microaggressions.  It can also mean any complaints about the conference or behavior of attendees being brushed off as disruptive to the existing exclusionary atmosphere that it appears this event has cultivated.

Going forward, if I see another line up of all $PRIVILEGED_GROUP speaking at your conference, I will have to assume you are actively working to run a conference to alienate $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  Since I’m not interested in that environment, this may be my last $CONFERENCE_NAME conference; I could instead have attended $OTHER_CONFERENCE_THAT_MADE_AN_EFFORT where I know I and my peers would both have felt more welcome.</p>

<p>Sample 2: (considering attending event)</p>

<p>Dear $$</p>

<p>When I saw the announcement for $EVENT_NAME I went to your website to see who would be speaking/presenting.  As I looked through the list of talks and speakers I did not see the presence of speakers who are $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  The presence of additional voices will spark conversations and insights that wouldn’t happen without the presence of $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  
</p>
<p>
There are a variety of ways in which unintentional bias can lead to homogenous speakers at an event. There are a variety of concrete ways to change this including $METHOD1 and $METHOD2. For further information please check out $SITE_NAME which has a variety of resources to help organizers increase diversity
</p>

<p>Sample 3: (considering conference)</p>
<p>
Dear $$
</p>
<p>
I saw the announcement for $CONFERENCE_NAME and was interested in attending.  When I looked over the list of speakers I noticed there was a lack of speakers who are $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  This was disappointing because I find that having more voices sparks conversations and insights that wouldn’t happen without the presence of $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  </p>

Sample 4</p>
<p>
Dear $$</p>
<p>
I saw the announcement for $CONFERENCE_NAME and was interested in attending.  When I looked over the list of speakers I noticed there was a lack of speakers who are $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  This was disappointing because I find that having more voices sparks conversations and insights that wouldn’t happen without the presence of $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.   </p>
<p>
I am both a member of this community and $MARGINALIZED_GROUP.  I find it discouraging to not see my presence reflected in the speakers.</p>
<p>
There are a variety of ways in which unintentional bias can lead to homogenous speakers at a conference. Mentioning diversity in calls for speakers, performing active outreach to marginalized groups,  and encouraging new people to become speakers are all methods of increasing the effectiveness of recruitment.</p>
<p>
It is necessary to take concrete steps to counteract bias in order to have a conference that reflects the strengths of our diverse community. For further information please check out $SITE_NAME which has a variety of resources to help organizers increase diversity</p>
